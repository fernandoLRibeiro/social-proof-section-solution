## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

With this challenge I learned not to overcomplicate things (meaning I should've just built this using good old HTML and CSS, instead of NextJS).

### Continued development

I need to get better at NextJS and discerning when to use a javascript library/framework over basic HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [How to detect window size in Next.js SSR using react hook?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63406435/how-to-detect-window-size-in-next-js-ssr-using-react-hook) - This helped me, as the title of the question suggests, how to detect window size in NextJS, which was more of a hassle than I anticipated.
